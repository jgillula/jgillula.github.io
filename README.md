# About the blog

This blog is just a place for me to collect documentation on my various random technical projects. It's not really meant for public consumption, but if you find something here that's helpful to you, great! On the flip side, it also means that I don't intend to provide much in the way of support or answer questions--sorry.

# Note to self

To add new posts, just copy an existing post in the [`_posts`](https://github.com/jgillula/jgillula.github.io/tree/main/_posts) directory, edit it, and then push to Github. The Github action will take care of updating the blog, though it may take a minute.

If you want to see what the post will look like locally before publishing, run
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
in the root directory of the repo.
